# League-of-Legends-Master-Pick
Don't know what champion to pick in league of legends? Worry no more. League of legends master pick allows you to input data from league statistics websites in order for it to tell you what champion you should pick based off what your allies and enemies picked in draft modes. Great for beginners. Python.

To use this, you have to go into shell functions, open up shell idle, and either copy paste or manually write everything from top to bottom inside the shell, then press enter twice. After that, you can start calling the functions manually. In order to make your life easier, I would advise prewriting the list used by the Compend variable, as this will save a ton of time and prevent you from having to rewrite everything all over again, which can take a very long time being that league of legends has nearly one hundred and fifty champions.
